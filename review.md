Day 1: variables store data values
data types: string, number, boolean,null, nan, array

Day 2: operatiors: basically math symbols + / \* /

Day 3: dom manipulation: getelementbyid is when you select an element by its id i think its more focused than  
class  as far as specificity is concerned
queryselector you can use .class notation for css to change the dom
preventDefault stops an action.
JSON = javascript object notation. lets the internet read your.

Day 4: Promises and async/await used for things that take a long time to code by hand.
Fetch - get information from the Web/api's
Tmeout- delay start time

Day 5: advance functions: ways to create objects
Prototypes: shares information so you won't have to reapeat code
Inheritance: objects can borrow code, again so there is not a lot of repetitive coding
